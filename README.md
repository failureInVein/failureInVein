# Hi, I’m Fuad 👋  
**Software Engineer | Algorithmic Thinker → Real-World Systems Builder**

I turn strong foundations in algorithms and problem-solving into practical, user-facing software systems.

---

### 🧠 Current Focus
- Converting algorithmic rigor into **production-grade software**
- Backend fundamentals with **clean architecture**
- Flutter UIs that balance **performance and UX**
- Building fewer projects — but shipping them properly

## 🚀 Highlighted Projects

Projects designed with **real use-cases, structure, and intent**:

| Project | Stack | Impact |
|---------|-------|--------|
| **ShopPage UI** | Flutter, Dart | Polished shop interface with collapsing search, pinned tabs, and category-based product flows |
| **Featured Car Listings** | PHP, CSS | Structured listing platform with reusable components and clean visual hierarchy |

> These are not demos — they are foundations for scalable applications.
